# startpage
Template for the web browser startpage used on the local network.

This page uses Bootstrapv4 CDN, otherwise it is html5 only. It uses Bootstrap cards for organization. It's not designed to be fancy or graphical in anyway

I use this for links I visit often for bills and places I visit daily without the need for a lot of bookmarks.
